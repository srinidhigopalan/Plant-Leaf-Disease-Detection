# Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection

This repository contains a plant leaf disease detection system built using TensorFlow and Streamlit. The system leverages a pre-trained deep learning model to identify diseases in plant leaves, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
app/
    - class_indices.json
    - main.py
    - requirements.txt
    - trained_model/
        - plant_disease_prediction_model.h5

app/: Contains the application code and dependencies.
  class_indices.json: A JSON file mapping class indices to disease names.
  main.py: The main script for running the Streamlit application.
  requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the application.
  trained_model/plant_disease_prediction_model.h5: The pre-trained model file.

## Dataset
The model was trained on the Plant Village dataset, which includes images of plant leaves categorized by various diseases. This dataset is publicly available and was used to train and evaluate the model's performance.
